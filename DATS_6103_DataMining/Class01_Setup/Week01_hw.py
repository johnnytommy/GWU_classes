# # Sample markdown cell
#
# This is a sample markdown cell.  
# Two spaces in the previous line doesn't make a new line in this environment. 
#
# You will need a blank line to get a new paragraph.

# The above is not considered a blank line without the # sign.
#
# This can get you a [link](http://www.gwu.edu).
#
# You can find some cheatsheets to do other basic stuff like bold-face, italicize, tables, etc.

#%%
# Question 1: Create a Markdown cell with the followings:
# Two paragraphs about yourself. In one of the paragraphs, give a hyperlink of a website 
# that you want us to see. Can be about yourself, or something you like.


#%%
# Question 2: Follow our InClass01.py python file, create
# a list of all the class titles that you are planning to take in the data science program. 
# Have at least 6 classes, even if you are not a DS major
# Then print out the last entry in your list.


#%%
# Question 3: After you completed question 2, you feel Intro to data mining is too stupid, so you are going 
# to replace it with Intro to Coal mining. Do that in python here.


#%%
# Question 4: Before you go see your acadmic advisor, you are 
# asked to create a python dictionary of the classes you plan to take, 
# with the course number as key. Please do that. Don't forget that your advisor 
# probably doesn't like coal. And that coal mining class doesn't even have a 
# course number.

#%%
# Question 5: print out and show your advisor how many 
# classes (print out the number, not the list/dictionary) you plan 
# to take.
