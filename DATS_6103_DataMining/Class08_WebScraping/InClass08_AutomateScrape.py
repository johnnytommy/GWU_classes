# The previous example uses what is called "get-method" query

# from the web server. Many modern websites do not use such methods.
# Interactions with the server can nowadays be using ajax, jQuery, other backend DB connections,

# For such situations, we can try to automate the browswer experience and navigate the site to pull the content

# Other things to consider...
#
# # Generator functions and recursive functions
#
# Let's say we are using automation to construct a web crawler, from one site, crawling to 
# other web links. A typical function to perform such task will be nested/recursive. And it is 
# often such task will be written as generator functions (remember them? list comprehension and 
# generator functions?) That way, the list could go on forever, from one site crawl to another, 
# but python will not wait for the entire list to be stored in memory to continue.
#
# # Async nature of web traffic, Promises, Watchers
#
# Procedural programming and traditional OOP are all sequential in nature. The flow of logic 
# is well structured. The web programming has provided a lot of challenges to these fundamental 
# practices in recent years. Communications between servers and clients are often routed in 
# complicated and asynchronous fashion. There is no guaranteed the codes executed first will be 
# completed first. For example, when the web client trying to connect to the server DB for query, 
# the response might not be received for a while, depending on the routing and the other connections. 
# It is impractical and almost impossible to always wait for the response before moving on to 
# other tasks. 
#
# So the latest web programming, with ajax, angular, typescript, and many others new frameworks, 
# all have the asynchronous nature in mind. The function calls often have options to wait for 
# the *promise* to be delivered before executing other related codes. (Called a promise.) 
# In many situations, we just move on and carry on with the rest of the codes, by there are 
# *watchers* implemented throughout. When the data (called model) is changed, say from the 
# server response eventually, for example, the watchers will alerted all involved to change 
# their status, and update their values if needed. If these are not setup properly, 
# there could be a lot of inconsistent and unexpected behavior on the web applications.
