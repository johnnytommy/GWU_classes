# have different data type between columns, unlike numpy arrays

#%% [markdown]
# ## Method 1, from lists directly
# If no index is specified, pandas will auto generate integral index

# # Data Structure
# 
# If you have learned or used database before, look at this dataframe using those lenses. 
# Is that usually how the data is stored in a DB (RDB)?  
# There are some replications and redundancies. 
# Can you spot them?
#
# For example, the values for 'season' is always the same, should we use one table for each season instead? 
# 
# Knowing the minutes of the game clock, why need to record the quarter qtr?
#
# Already have the record of home and away teams, knowing which one is the kickteam, why do we need to record the defense def?
#
# There are more than 10 games on a typical day, should we group them in a table for, say, week_n, therefore 
# no need to repeat the same date for 10+ times? Is that easier for storage and for retrival for data to be 
# stored in such RDB fashion?
#
# We are not here to say which method or system is best to store data and retrival. There are just so many reasons, good reasons, 
# why things are done in certain ways. 
#
# We will find ourselves in many situations the data collect is not in a form that is convenient to our analysis. 
# We might need to perform sql joins, lookups, merge tables, pivot tables, etc, (data wrangling) to prepare the data for our analysis.
