# OOP -- Object Oriented Programming 
# class
# class can be thought of bundling properties (like variables) and functions (or called methods) together
# This is not a requirement, but good practice to use Capitalize first letter for classes, 
# variables or functions instances use regular lowercase first letter.

# ## From a programmer's perspective on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
# 
# Read this [blog at Medium on OOP](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/goodbye-object-oriented-programming-a59cda4c0e53). 
# To put all these into context, from procedural progamming (such as C) to OOP (C++, java and the likes) was a 
# huge paradigm shift. The world has progressed however, and there are new needs, and new wants, from the new generations. 
# And there are new answers in response. Keep up with the new ideas and concepts. 
# That's how to stay ahead. 
# Just like OOP still uses a lot of concepts and functionality in procedure programming, 
# the new programming paradigm will continue to use OOP concepts and tools as the backbone. 
# Try to get as much as you can, although you might not consider yourself a programmer. 
# These will serve you well, and makes you a more logical thinker.
